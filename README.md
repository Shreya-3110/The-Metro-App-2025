Metro App
Overview
The Metro App is a simple Java-based application that simulates a metro map, allowing users to manage metro stations and routes. The app provides the functionality to add metro stations, connect them, and find the shortest path between two stations using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

This application features a GUI built with Java Swing to visually interact with the metro stations and routes. The app can be easily customized to simulate any metro network.

Features
Station Management: Add, view, and manage metro stations.

Station Connections: Create connections (routes) between two stations.

Shortest Path Calculation: Find the shortest path between two stations using the BFS algorithm.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): A simple and interactive interface to visualize metro routes and stations.

Error Handling: Basic error handling to ensure smooth user interaction.

Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language for implementing the logic and functionality.

Swing: Java library used to create the graphical user interface (GUI).

Java Collections: Used for data storage and manipulation (e.g., HashMap, ArrayList).

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Java: Ensure Java is installed on your system. You can verify by running the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
java -version
IDE: You can use any Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse to open and run the project.

Steps to Run the Application
Clone the Repository (if hosted on GitHub):

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/metro-app.git
(Replace with your actual repository URL if applicable)

Navigate to the Project Folder:
Use the terminal or command prompt to navigate to the src directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd E:\MY METRO APP\src
Compile the Java Files:
In the terminal, compile the Java files:

bash
Copy
Edit
javac *.java
Run the Application:
After compilation, run the main class:

bash
Copy
Edit
java Main
This will launch the metro app with a console-based output of stations and their connections.

Usage Instructions
Add Stations: Add stations to your metro map using the GUI or console commands.

Connect Stations: Connect stations to simulate metro lines.

Find Shortest Path: Input two stations, and the app will calculate the shortest path using BFS.

Error Handling: If you try to add or connect stations that do not exist, an error message will be displayed.

Future Improvements
Customizable Metro Networks: Ability to simulate different cities' metro systems.

Advanced Routing Algorithms: Integrating other algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s for optimal pathfinding.

Enhanced GUI: More advanced features like zooming and station icons.

Database Integration: Storing metro maps and routes in a database for persistence.
